Peerâ€™s project: Raniel’s sliding puzzle game
What is something you learned by reviewing your peerâ€™s project?
	I learned that there is a lot more I could of done with my project such as making the columns turn various colors when the right letter was in it.
What is something you saw in your peerâ€™s project that you would like to apply to your own programming projects?
	The use of being unique and creative. I liked how he went beyond the directions and improved the game to make it more unique. Instead of just numbers it is a complicated word game that I was unable to solve.
What suggestions would you have for your peer to improve his/her code?
	I was confused at first because I thought the colors meant it was in the right spot. Maybe you could make it change yellow if it is in the right column and green if it is in the right spot instead.
What could have been clearer or better commented?
	Like I just said, the use of turning the blocks green confused me because I thought they were in the right spot
Was there anything in the code that was confusing to you? If so, what?
	The same thing applies here. The only confusing part was when they switched to green and I thought that meant they were in the right spot until I closely read the read me.
What is something he/she could add to the README.md to make it more descriptive?
It was a little long, but it was very detailed and good. I should of probably of read it before trying to play
Pay a compliment to your peer based on the quality of his/her code.
	The code and the game are very impressive, and I am amazed that you were able to do some of the stuff you did such as turning the columns green and red. I saw you wanted to make them wood too which would have been cool. It really shows you are very creative and unique.
